This is an experimental project not intended to be production ready code.

The project contains R code to pre-process Uganda and UK open contracting data (in OCDS format) downloaded from https://www.open-contracting.org/data/ and Python code to explore the data. More about the open contracting data standard (OCDS) here: https://standard.open-contracting.org/latest/en/.
